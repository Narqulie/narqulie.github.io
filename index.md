Hi, I'm **Johan Henrik Edvard Aminoff**, but you can call me Henrik. I live in Tampere, Finland, and have devoted a significant part of my life to adult education, especially emphasizing IT and languages. With a Master's degree from the University of Lapland and a myriad of skills, I've interwoven my passions for teaching, technology, and continuous learning.

My "tech stack" includes Python, and I'm well versed in robotic process automation, using UiPath, as well as Python. I'm also familiar with various other technologies, such as SQL, REST APIs, and HTML. I've worked with a variety of platforms, especially when it comes to integrations and data management. I have a working knowledge of the IPAAS-platform FRENDS.

Professionally, my journey has spanned roles from system specialist to integrating and automating processes using RPA. I've worn multiple hats - from customer service, system integration, to robotic process automation utilizing platforms like UiPath, FRENDS, and M-Files. 

In addition to my technological pursuits, I pride myself on fostering positive relationships. I believe in the power of communication, evident from my fluency in Finnish and English, complemented by a proficient command of Swedish.

When I'm not in the tech realm, you might find me engaged in electronics projects, woodworking, or perhaps enjoying a calm day fishing. My affinity for art, renovation, and the continuous urge to discover keeps my zest for life ignited.
