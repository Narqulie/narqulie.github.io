Hi, I'm **Johan Henrik Edvard Aminoff**, but you can call me Henrik. I'm a nerd who has liked computers since the 1990's, and I've gathered a great deal of knowledge and experience over the years. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I've been using Python for a few years now. With my profound interest in things that go beep and blink, I've been able to combine my passion for technology with my love for learning. I've tinkered with all kinds of systems and technologies, and I'm always eager to learn more.

With a Master's degree from the University of Lapland and a myriad of skills, I've interwoven my passions for teaching, technology, and continuous learning.
I'm interested in technology and innovation, and it's effect on people and the world. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to improve our lives, and I'm always looking for new ways to utilize it. I also acknowledge the fact that change and innovation have costs and need to be managed. I'm interested in the human side of technology, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the user experience.

Professionally, my journey has spanned roles from HR, system specialist to integrating and robotic process automation. I've worn multiple hats - from customer service, system integration, to developer, as well as a shop steward and teacher and trainer.

My "tech stack" includes Python, and I'm well versed in robotic process automation using UiPath and python. I'm also familiar with many other technologies, such as SQL, REST APIs, Bash and Powershell and overall I'm familiar with a myriad of HR and payroll systems.
I've worked with a variety of platforms, especially when it comes to integrations and data management. I have a working knowledge of the IPAAS-platform FRENDS, and I am currency learning Swift and iOS development. 
I know Robot Framework for test automation, and I'm familiar with Selenium and Playwright for process automation. 

In addition to my technological pursuits, I pride myself on fostering positive relationships. I believe in the power of communication, evident from my fluency in Finnish and English, complemented by a proficient command of Swedish.
When I'm not in the tech realm, you might find me engaged in electronics projects, woodworking, or perhaps enjoying a calm day fishing. I love playing videogames. My continuous urge to discover keeps me busy.
